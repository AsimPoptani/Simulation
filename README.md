# Simulation for Group C

**Submersive Class** - A class that Simulates a submersive vehicle.

**Submersive Enum Class** - A class that holds States of the submersive vehicle.

**Submersive Sprite Class** - A class that takes a Subermsive and draws it.

**Windmill Class** - A class that Simulates a windmill.

**Windmill Sprite Class** - A class that takes a Windmill and draws it.

### Few key notes:

You can run the simulation without running the GUI (so we can quickly test the code), to run a simulation call `step()` through each class.




### TODO
- [ ] Add a description of the project
- [ ] Add noise to the simulation
- [ ] Get the actual probablities for windmills breaking down
- [ ] Create a list of things we want to simulate e.g. Batterylife, windmill power out
- [ ] Add images instead of circles and squares for the sprites
- [ ] Use a constraint solver/optimizer to find the best solution for swarm
- [ ] Figure out if we want to implement aerial units as well
- [ ] Base the drone on an actual drone
- [ ] Get the planned site for the wind farm
- [ ] Simulate the master boat?
- [ ] Simulate communications between drones and the master boat
- [ ] Create Github Project and put these todo in there
- [x] Add team members to the project
- [ ] Finalise architecture
- [ ] Do we want to simulate failure to detect?
- [ ] What is our success evaluation metric what are we trying to maximize or minimize? Is it time? Is it battery efficiency? 
- [ ] Do we want to simulate the drone not responding?
